### GUI Tools for MongoDB Operations:
---------------------------------

Up to this point, we have performed database operations using the mongo shell. The advantage of using the shell is that we have to do everything, which provides more learning opportunities.

However, in real-time usage, the shell is not recommended due to the following reasons:

1. **Auto completion is not available**: We have to type complete commands.
2. **Error-prone complex queries**: Writing complex queries is more error-prone.
3. **No help tips**: No help tips are available.
4. **Readability issues**: Readability is not up to the mark.
5. **No coloring**: No coloring is available.
6. **Complex operations**: Operations can become very complex.
7. **Not convenient to use**: It is not that much convenient to use, etc.

To overcome these problems, we have to use GUI-based tools like:

1. **Robo 3T**
2. **Studio 3T**
3. **Compass**
4. **NoSQL Manager**
5. etc.
