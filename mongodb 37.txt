MongoDB with Python:
````````````````````

Upto this we communicated with MongoDB server by using mongodb shell. ie. MongoDB associated as a client to perofrm our required database operations.


Python communicate with mongodb using pymongo Drive software

Steps:
`````

1. import pymongo
    >> from pymongo import *

2. Create a client to communicate with mongodb server
    >> client = MongoClient()
    >> client = MongoClient(localhost,27017)
    >> client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
    >> client = MongoClient("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/")


3. Create/connect to database
    >> db = client["EmployeeDB"]

4. Create or connect to collection
    >> collection = db.employees 

5. By using collection object we can perform all database operations

A. To insert a document:

    collection.insert_one()
    collection.insert_many()
    collection.insert()

B. To read a document:

    collection.find_one()
    collection.find_many()
    collection.find()

C. To update a document:

    collection.update_one()
    collection.update_many()
    collection.update()

D. To delete a document:

    collection.delete_one()
    collection.delete_many()
    collection.delete()



6. To close the connection:

    client.close()

 
 eg-1: Write a python scrpit to connect to mongodb server and display the list of available databases?

 We have to use client.list_database_names() to get the list of available databases
