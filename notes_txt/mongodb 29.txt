GUI Tools for MongoDB Operations: 
--------------------------------- 

Upto this we performed the database operations by using mongo shell. 
The advantage of using shell is we have to do everything so that 
learning opportunity is more. 

But in real time usage of shell is not recommended because of the following reasons: 

1. Auto completion is not available. We have to type complete 
command. 
2. While writing complex queries, more error prone. 
3. No help tips 
4. Readability is not up to the mark. 
5. No coloring 
6. Operations will become very complex 
7. Not that much convenient to use etc

To overcome these problems we have to use GUI based tools like   
1. Robo 3T   
2. Studio 3T   
3. Compass   
4. NoSQL Manager   
etc

1. Robo 3T: 
----------- 
The Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) tool has been acquired by 3T 
Software Labs, the creators of the MongoDB client Studio 3T (formerly 
MongoChef). 
It is freeware and lightweight GUI tool for MongoDB operations.
